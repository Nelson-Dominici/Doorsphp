## ðŸŒ± Funcionalidades do projeto
I will mention only the files/folders that will be useful for you to create your api:

- `bootstrap.php`: This file is responsible for initializing (those that need to be initialized first) the project's dependencies.
- `app\Handle`: The Handle folder is responsible for handling SPECIFIC parts of the API (DO NOT EXCLUDE THE REQUEST/ROUTE FOLDER).
- `app\Modules`: The Modules folder is responsible for grouping functions for specific entities (the User folder within it is an example).
- `app\Route`: The only relevant thing inside the AllRoutes folder for creating your API is the AllRoutes.php file, responsible for grouping all the API routes.
- `app\Utils`: The Utils folder is responsible for grouping files that can be called throughout the API.
