<h2>ðŸš€ About</h2>
<p>
  PHP-API is an api made in pure php, without any dependence, created to serve as a starting point for other APIS, it contains some features that will facilitate the creation of your api such as:
<p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy use of routes.</li>
  <li>Routes with URI Params.</li>
  <li>Easy access to Query Params.</li>
  <li>Access to the body of the request independent of the http method.</li>
  <liBody data protected against xss attacks.</li>
  <li>Possibility to request mandatory data in the body.</li>
</ul>

<h2>âš™ Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PHP version =>8.1.13</li>
  <li>composer version =>2.5.1</li>
</ul>

## ðŸŒ± Structure

- `index.php`: API main file. 
- `bootstrap.php`: Responsible for initializing (those that need to be initialized first) the API dependencies.
- `app\Handle`: Responsible for handling SPECIFIC parts of the API (DO NOT DELETE THE REQUEST/ROUTE FOLDER).
- `app\Modules`: Responsible for grouping roles for specific entities (the User folder within it is an example).
- `app\Route`: Group functions of routes.
- `app\Utils`: Responsible for grouping the files that can be called throughout the API.

## ðŸŒ¿ How to use
<p>

Creating the API will revolve around the app\Modules folder. As mentioned in the topic above, this folder is responsible for grouping the functions of a specific entity, functions such as: Services, Controller and Routes, you can add as many as you want. Inside it there is a folder called User which is an entity to serve as an example, containing files with these functions. Now let's talk about these functions using these files as an example:

</p>

### ðŸ—º Routes
<p>

After creating an entity, you need to create a file with the routes of that entity, see the example that comes in the API:
</p>

```php
<?php

return $userRoutes = [

	"POST" => [

		"/user/post" => [	
			"funcPath" => "User:UserController:postExample",
			"mandatoryData" => ["name", "email", "password"]
		],
	],
  
  	"GET" => [

		"/" => [	
			"funcPath" => "User:UserController:absoluteRouteExample",
		],
	],
  
];
```
<p>
It is worth noting that the fights are separated by http methods, the path of the function that will be executed after accessing the route is passed in the funcPath field, first the module name is passed, then the controller name, and finally the name of the method .
</p>
